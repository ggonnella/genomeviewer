== Getting started

1. Install the genometools libraries (libgtcore.so, libgtext.so, libgtview.so) on your system.
   The libraries can be obtained via http://www.genometools.org
   If you do not have root prvileges on your machine make sure that the genometools libraries
   can be found by your os.
2. Put the path to the gtruby files in the environment variable GTRUBY
   If you are using a bash shell use export GTRUBY=/path/to/gtruby
3. navigate to the genomeviewer directory
   3.1 setup the database used by genomeviewer (rake db:schema:load)
   3.2 start the genometools server (script/gt_server)
   3.3 start the web server (script/server)
   3.4 optional: start the session deamon (script/session_deamon)

== Possible problems

1. In case the rake process or the server processes produce an error message saying somthing
   like "can't convert nil into String" you probabely did not set the GTRUBY variable in your
   current environment)
