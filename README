== Getting started

1. Install the shared GenomeTools library (libgenometools.[so|dylib]) on your
   system. The library can be obtained via http://genometools.org
   If you do not have root prvileges on your machine make sure that the
   GenomeTools library can be found by your OS.
2. Put the path to the gtruby files in the environment variable GTRUBY
   If you are using a bash shell use export GTRUBY=/path/to/gtruby
3. Navigate to the GenomeViewer directory
   3.1 Start the GenomeTools server (script/gt_server)
   3.2 Setup the database used by GenomeViewer
        - Usually this can be done with "rake db:load"
        - If you want to preload an example user (login:foo/pass:foo)
          use "rake db:load_with_foo" instead
        (a guest account will be in both cases also created)
   3.3 Start the web server (script/server)
   3.4 Optional: start the session daemon (script/session_daemon)

== Possible problems

1. In case the rake process or the server processes produce an error message
   saying somthing like "can't convert nil into String" you probabely did not
   set the GTRUBY variable in your current environment.
