 Creating a new controller:

 1)	The default layout (app/views/layout/application.rhtml) is loaded.
   
         override:   create a layout with the name of the controller in app/views/layout 

 2)	The stylesheet for the whole application is loaded (public/stylesheet/default.css)

 3)	If you use the standard layout you can automatically load a menu if you create the partial  app/views/<controllername>/_navbar.rhtml

 4)	If you want to load extra stylesheets for the controller, write in the controller initializer code:

        def initialize
          @stylesheets = <stylesheetnames>
        end


Creating a new view:

 1)	 The default layout for the controller is applied, if not present the application's default is applied

          override: write in the controller „layout <layoutname>, :only => :<actioname>“ 

 2)	 If you use the default layout you can include a menu. This can be for the whole controller (see section „creating a new controller“) or to create an extra menu for the action do the following:

          create a partial with the code of the menu
          in the action code (controller) write:
          @navbar = (render_to_string :partial => <partialname>)
