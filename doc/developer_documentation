Creating a new view:

 1)	 The default layout for the controller is applied, if not present the application's default is applied

          override: write in the controller �layout <layoutname>, :only => :<actioname>� 

 2)	 If you use the default layout you can include a menu. This can be for the whole controller (see section �creating a new controller�) or to create an extra menu for the action do the following:

          create a partial with the code of the menu
          in the action code (controller) write:
          @navbar = (render_to_string :partial => <partialname>)
