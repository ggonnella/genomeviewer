------------

General project rules:

- follow the rules in this files which will be modified as the project
progresses
- the ``roadmap'' is defined by the file doc/todo_list
- the only work which ``counts'' are proper commits with meaningful
commit messages
- a commit either implements exactly one feature or fixes exactly one
 bug
- if a commit finishes a todo item, the doc/todo_list file should be
modified with this commit accordingly
- if a commit opens up a new todo item, the doc/todo_list file should
be modified with this commit accordingly
- write proper unit and functional tests for all features
- no quick hacks, in the long run they produce more work than they save

Don'ts:

- no binary files in the repository (e.g., RTF files)
- no SQL statements in the code (use the ActiveRecord ORM, thats the
whole point of it)
- no source line longer than 80 characters
- no GenomeTools source code in the repository
