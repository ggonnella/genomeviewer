   <h1>Welcome to the GenomeViewer</h1>
   
    <p>
    The <i>GenomeViewer</i> is a viewer of GFF annotations. It is based 
    on the <i><a href="http://www.genometools.org" title="Genome Tools">Genome Tools</a></i>. In particular the visualisation is based on the 
    C library <a href="http://www.genometools.org/libgtview.html" title="Genome Tools libGtView library"><tt>libgtview</tt></a>.
    </p>
    <p>
    It is possible to create an account (select "register" from the menu on the right), upload the own GFF files and see them online. A public repository of GFF annotation is also available and the own files can be marked as public and added to the directory.
