  # Transactional fixtures accelerate your tests by wrapping each test method
  # in a transaction that's rolled back on completion.  This ensures that the
  # test database remains unchanged so your fixtures don't have to be reloaded
  # between every test method.  Fewer database queries means faster tests.

  # Every Active Record database supports transactions except MyISAM tables
  # in MySQL.  Turn off transactional fixtures in this case; however, if you
  # don't care one way or the other, switching from MyISAM to InnoDB tables
  # is recommended.

  # Instantiated fixtures are slow, but give you @david where otherwise you
  # would need people(:david).  If you don't want to migrate your existing

  # instantiated fixtures translates to a database query per test method),

  # an annotation for an user, so that you have:

  # - @_a => annotation
  # - @_sr => sequence region
  # - @_ft => feature type
  # - @_c => style
  # - @_f => format
